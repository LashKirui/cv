    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). 
            The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, 
            societal, and policy implications of computing and information.
        </li>
        <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
            <ul>
                <li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. 
                    The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. 
                    To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
